      <p class="small">Dear Daun,
      </p>
      <p class="text-center xsmall" style="overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x:hidden; height: 260px;" >When i met you I thought 
I was through with love
Was just in it for the fun
Wasnt really expecting alot

I guess you thought the same
Just two people
Trying to stay sane
Wanting to find an escape

I'll be honest
I didn't really think it through
Part of me was'nt sure
How things would go with you

I guess you thought the same
Just two people
Avoiding past mistakes
Trying not to hurt again

I dont know what to believe in
But if it you and me I'm willing
To leap into the unknown
I'm letting go of all control

I'm frefalling down, down, 
Down into your arms
Hold me down, down, down
Don't you dare let go
I love you down, down, down
From the bottom of my heart
So down, down, down here I go

Yeah I'ts intense, I know
People might think I'm stupid
Fell inlove within a month
I'm not being very lucid

I guess they'd doubt and say
We're just too hopeful
Its thousands of miles away
But through it all
You make me wanna stay

If its you, i know 
That i wont regret a thing
Even though i go, just know 
I'll come right back again

I'll believe in you and say
I am hopeful
I know we'll find a way
I dont care if it sounds cliche

Now I know what to believe in
If its you and me I'm willing
To fly into the unknown
I'm giving God all the control

I'm frefalling down, down,
Down into your warmth
Hold me down, down, down
Let me just say
i love you down, down, down
With all of my heart
So down, down, down
With you I'll stay

I don't know alot of things 
And what will happen next
Just taking things day by day
Moments with you are the best

I think you're perfect
And I feel safe with you
I feel blessed beyond compare
To have met you, when im lost
And i dont know where to go
There's no direction I'd rather go but

Down, down, down into your love
Thank you down, down, down
For being bornn 
I love you down, down, down
No matter where you are
So down, down, down 
Let me be the only one
to stay

Let love you not just now
but into the future
It's 1:14 pm, thank you again
for being born
I know i can't hold you now
But hopefully next year i can
